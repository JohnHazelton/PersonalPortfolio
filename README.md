# Personal Portfolio Website
A personal website originally developed using just HTML, CSS, and a bit of jQuery. I have since redesigned & begun to rebuild a more robust version of the site using Vue.js. This code is still a work in-progress, with some sections to be added and some stylistic polishing needed before deploying. 

The original version of the site can be viewed at johncwhazelton.com
